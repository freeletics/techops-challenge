# FREELETICS TECHOPS CHALLENGE



Every day we work to build an artificial intelligent personal coach used by our [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6324331771210995731) & [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/freeletics-gmbh/id579309595) apps that helps over 50 million people around the world become their best version. Our engineering team takes the same approach to become their best version of their code. We continuously strive to be better. Here you will find a challenge of our techops team with issues and designs we face on our day to day business.



**Scope of the challenge:**

The code itself is using terraform to provision a jenkins ci/cd service on a local minikube and provision a sample docker build job.



Prerequisites:

[minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

[terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

**Motivation:**

In a lot of challenges you were asked for a specific command like ...

```python
sqs = boto3.???
```

Maybe you know the answer right away

```python
sqs = boto3.client('sqs')
```

The answer tells us whether you have active knowledge about boto3 framework to work with sqs on aws. We believe here at freeletics that tools may change and the personality is more important. So we search for people with great analytics skills. So our challenge is more referring to general issues with design and the implementation and we hided some eastereggs to keep the fun.



**What do we expect as a response?**

A short markdown file or any other text format that you are used with.
It shall show us how you approached the challenge, shows the steps you did and 
most important the issues you faced and how you overcome them.
See [here](Example.md) an example for a report.
We hope you have the same fun solving the riddles as we had to design them.

[Go ahead!](Challenge.md)
