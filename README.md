that helps over 50 million people around the world become their best version.
Our engineering team takes the same approach to become their best version of
their code. We continuously strive to be better. Here you will find a challenge
of our techops team with issues and designs we face on our day to day business.

## HOW TO DELIVER IT?

In case you feel like you haven't expressed yourself enough with the code, feel
free to include a markdown file containing description and contexts, we are also
big fans and appreciators of code commentaries (write them as much as you like,
we will read).

Once you're done with the code and its knowledge sharing, send us an e-mail with
a ZIP file containing the solution for your challenge.

**What do we expect to see?**

The solution shall show us how you approached the challenge, broke it down into
smaller pieces, and got it done. As well as your troubleshooting and analytical
skills, and most important your eagerness to overcome issues.

We hope you have the same fun solving the riddles as we had designing them, and
that you are eager to **become a better version of yourself**
